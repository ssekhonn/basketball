</h2><br>The NBA was initially founded as the <b>Basketball Association of America (BAA)</b> in 1946, merging with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949 to form the NBA. The league has undergone many changes over the years, from the addition of teams to the establishment of iconic events like the <b>NBA All-Star Game </b> and <b>NBA Finals</b>. The NBA has grown from a small, regional league into a global sports entertainment phenomenon, with players like<b> Michael Jordan</b>,<b>LeBron James</b> , and <b>Kobe Bryant</b> becoming international superstars.
<br>Throughout its history, the NBA has expanded, with teams now spread across two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference.
